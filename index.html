  <body><p>Welcome to my labor of love, my app, ScanAvert.  Most apps exist to make money off you; mine exists to make money for you.  You may ask, as my family did, well how will you make money?  Actually, I don't-cue the sound of investors exiting this page. But that's the point.ScanAvert was not created for profit, it was created to improve health individually and collectively.  Individually, you receive incompatibility information, suggested substitutes, recommendations, based on your dictated criteria. Collectively, our data reveals correlation between consumables, disease, symptoms, and prescription, yielding information on treatements, population health statistics and need, and yet to be discovered relationships.</p>
